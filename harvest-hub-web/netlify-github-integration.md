# Alternative: Netlify GitHub Integration (Even Easier!)

If you prefer an even simpler setup without managing tokens, use Netlify's built-in GitHub integration:

## Super Simple Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Connect Repository
1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. **Add new site** â†’ **Import from Git**
3. **Connect to GitHub** â†’ Authorize Netlify
4. **Pick your repository** from the list

### 2. Configure Build Settings
```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: harvest-hub-web/dist
Base directory: harvest-hub-web
```

### 3. Deploy!
- Click **Deploy site**
- Netlify will build and deploy automatically
- Every push to main = automatic deployment

## Benefits vs GitHub Actions

### Netlify Integration:
- âœ… **Easier setup** (no tokens needed)
- âœ… **Built-in previews** for PRs
- âœ… **Netlify dashboard** shows everything
- âœ… **Form handling** built-in (future use)
- âœ… **Functions** for serverless (Phase 1)

### GitHub Actions:
- âœ… **More control** over build process
- âœ… **Custom steps** (testing, linting, etc.)
- âœ… **Multiple environments** 
- âœ… **Works with any hosting** provider

## Recommendation

For HarvestHub, I suggest **Netlify GitHub Integration** because:
1. **Simpler setup** - just authorize and go
2. **Perfect for your needs** - React app deployment
3. **Room to grow** - can add Netlify Functions later
4. **Built-in features** - forms, redirects, etc.

You can always switch to GitHub Actions later if you need more control.

## Quick Start with Netlify Integration

1. **Push your code** to GitHub (if not already)
2. **Go to Netlify** â†’ Import from Git
3. **Select repository** and configure build
4. **Deploy** and get your URL
5. **Update QR codes** with new domain

That's it! Your app will auto-deploy on every commit. ðŸš€
